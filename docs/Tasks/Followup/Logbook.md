> | `fde9490` | g4 | Split 5 Service+DTO pair files the `*Models.cs` grep missed (HookToolProcessInvocationResolver, ToolDescriptorResolver, DotnetRuntimeCompatibilitySupport, DotnetToolSettingsReader, OpenCliCommandTreeBuilder). 15 files touched. |
> | `450e808` | g5 | Split the 2 cross-cutting service+DTO pairs where the DTO is used far from its declaration (`ProcessResult`, `StaticAnalysisFrameworkAdapter`). Remaining 22 service+DTO pairs left inline under the tight-coupling exception. |
> | `59ba4a2` | g6 | Synced `README.md` Project Layout with the 5 source + 2 test projects. |

## Current Open Items After `g43` Fresh-Swarm Wave 1 (2026-04-12)

This section supersedes the older post-`g43` hosted-validation snapshot below
for current execution state.

**Current validated pushed tip and CI surface:**

- pushed branch tip: `6bb272d`
- green `pull_request` run `24300661250`
- latest green `workflow_dispatch` remains `24296167355` on `a3390bb`

**Wave summary and ranking outcome:**

- wave 1 converged strongly on the already-ranked remaining clusters rather
  than surfacing a materially new smell family
- the repeated HIGHs were: hosted Playwright CI coverage, generated static-HTML
  public-contract drift, and frontend code-size policy enforcement
- the repeated MEDIUMs were: local Playwright stale-cache / weak-assertion
  hygiene, process and viewer diagnostics preservation, installed-tool
  determinism, static-analysis degradation handling, docs/UI drift, and
  architecture-scanner / boundary-assertion gaps
- active implementation pick:
  `TN-2026-04-12-04` targets the Playwright CI gap first because it closes one
  remaining HIGH together with two adjacent MEDIUMs in a narrow CI/E2E slice
- no new smell category was discovered in wave 1

**Still-open ranked clusters after wave 1:**

- **HIGH: hosted CI still does not execute the Playwright E2E suite.**
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` still runs frontend unit tests plus build, but not
  `npm run test:e2e`.
- **HIGH: generated static HTML still overstates several public viewer
  features.**
  The generated static viewer still renders `Home` without honoring the
  `--show-home` contract and still does not implement the advertised static
  `browse` / `upload` flows.
- **HIGH: frontend code-size policy is unenforced and already violated.**
  `RepositoryCodeFilePolicyTests.cs` still ignores `*.ts` / `*.tsx`, while
  `CIGuidePage.tsx` and `NugetBrowser.tsx` exceed the repo hard cap.
- **MEDIUM: local Playwright still has stale-cache and weak-assertion risks.**
  The shared `.rendered` cache can mask current-output regressions, and the
  theme-toggle E2E still passes when the toggle is absent.
- **MEDIUM: process and viewer failure diagnostics still discard useful
  stdout/timeout evidence.**
  `ProcessRunner.cs` and
  `Rendering/Html/Bundle/ViewerBundleProcessSupport.cs` still collapse many
  non-zero or timed-out failures to exit codes or short timeout messages even
  when stdout contains the actionable error text.
- **MEDIUM: installed-tool selection and action versioning remain
  nondeterministic.**
  Installed-tool analysis still picks the first matching
  `DotnetToolSettings.xml`, and the composite action still lets ambient
  `inspectra` on `PATH` override `inspectra-version`.
- **MEDIUM: static-analysis mode still drops help-crawl degradation signals.**
  `StaticAnalysisInstalledToolAnalysisSupport.cs` does not fail on help-crawl
  output-limit or guardrail failures the way the sibling help/CliFx analyzers
  do.
- **MEDIUM: public docs, website copy, and the CI guide still drift from the
  real product contract.**
  Current gaps include stale package-mode XML-doc claims and website wording
  around temporary project mutation, plus broader CI-guide input drift.
- **MEDIUM: architecture enforcement is still bypassable in several places.**
  The shell/engine scanners still rely on plain `using` detection in multiple
  suites, leaving fully qualified or alias-based forbidden edges invisible.

## Current Open Items After `g43` Hosted Validation (2026-04-12)

This section supersedes the older post-`g41` snapshot below for current
execution state.

**Current validated pushed tip and CI surface:**

- pushed branch tip: `6bb272d`
- green `pull_request` run `24300661250`
- latest green `workflow_dispatch` remains `24296167355` on `a3390bb`

**Queue-handling work closed on `g42`/`g43`:**

- `TN-2026-04-12-03` is complete on `g42` (`6ccb5b7`) and `g43` (`6bb272d`)
- `g42` changed the PR `Validate nupkg` lane to install the just-built package
  into a temp `--tool-path`, then assert the installed
  `.store/.../tools/*/any/hooks/` payload layout that the runtime hook
  resolver depends on
- the first hosted run (`24300589542`) failed because the temp `NuGet.Config`
  wrote the local package source as a relative path, which the runner resolved
  relative to `/tmp`
- `g43` anchored that package source to an absolute directory, and rerun
  `24300661250` completed green
- local validation on the final tree included:
  - package-layout install simulation with temp `--tool-path` plus temp
    single-source config ✅
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` YAML parse ✅

**Still-open ranked clusters pending the fresh post-`6bb272d` swarm:**

- **HIGH: hosted CI still does not execute the Playwright E2E suite.**
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` still runs frontend unit tests plus build, but not
  `npm run test:e2e`.
- **HIGH: generated static HTML still overstates several public viewer
  features.**
  The currently shipped static viewer does not honor the documented
  `--enable-url` behavior and does not implement the advertised
  `--show-home` / `--enable-nuget-browser` / `--enable-package-upload`
  contract.
- **HIGH: frontend code-size policy is unenforced and already violated.**
  `CIGuidePage.tsx` is `744` lines, the repo-wide policy is not enforced for
  `.tsx`, and the frontend slice can drift past the documented hard cap without
  CI catching it.
- **MEDIUM: process and viewer failure diagnostics still discard useful
  stdout/timeout evidence.**
  `ProcessRunner.cs` and
  `Rendering/Html/Bundle/ViewerBundleProcessSupport.cs` still collapse many
  non-zero or timed-out failures to exit codes or short timeout messages even
  when stdout contains the actionable error text.
- **MEDIUM: installed-tool selection and action versioning remain
  nondeterministic.**
  Installed-tool analysis still picks the first matching
  `DotnetToolSettings.xml`, and the composite action still lets ambient
  `inspectra` on `PATH` override `inspectra-version`.
- **MEDIUM: static-analysis mode still drops help-crawl degradation signals.**
  `StaticAnalysisInstalledToolAnalysisSupport.cs` does not fail on help-crawl
  output-limit or guardrail failures the way the sibling help/CliFx analyzers
  do.
- **MEDIUM: public docs, website copy, and the CI guide still drift from the
  real product contract.**
  Current gaps include outdated CLI commands on `AboutPage`, stale CI-guide
  input coverage, README/Pages claims that no longer match deployment, and
  docs that overstate the current HTML feature-flag defaults.
- **MEDIUM: architecture enforcement is still bypassable in several places.**
  The shell/engine scanners still rely on plain `using` detection in multiple
  suites, `StartupHook` packaging-only metadata is not asserted, and some
  documented boundaries such as `Rendering.Html` vs `Rendering.Markdown` still
  lack executable coverage.
- **MEDIUM: the local Playwright suite still has stale-cache and weak-assertion
  risks even before it is wired into hosted CI.**
  The shared `.rendered` cache can mask current-output regressions, and the
  theme-toggle E2E still passes when the toggle is absent.

## Current Open Items After `g41` Hosted Validation (2026-04-12)

This section supersedes the older post-`a08c0f2` ranking snapshot below for
current execution state.

**Current validated pushed tip and CI surface:**

- pushed branch tip: `29a526c`
- `dotnet test InSpectra.Gen.sln --no-restore` ✅ (`354 / 0 / 0`)
- architecture filter ✅ (`17 / 0 / 0`)
- green `pull_request` run `24300030057`
- latest green `workflow_dispatch` remains `24296167355` on `a3390bb`

**Queue-handling work closed on `g41`:**

- `TN-2026-04-12-02` is complete on `g41` (`29a526c`)
- installed-tool help/CliFx/hook crawls now keep the real caller working
  directory while using engine-owned cleanup roots only
- package acquisition, native opencli generation, and xmldoc extraction now
  propagate the same engine-owned cleanup root through the runner seams
- timeout cleanup now always escalates to sandbox cleanup, dotnet-hosted
  processes can be matched back to sandboxed entry commands, hook retry replay
  is environment-aware across compatibility changes, and compatibility retries
  no longer stop on stale pre-existing env values
- CliFx child-command discovery now normalizes root-qualified command names
  before enqueueing follow-up help captures

**Fresh post-`g41` investigation wave 1 summary:**

- wave 1 converged strongly on the already-ranked remaining clusters rather
  than surfacing a materially new smell family
- the repeated HIGHs were: hosted Playwright CI coverage, generated static-HTML
  public-contract drift, packaged-tool/StartupHook verification, and frontend
  code-size policy enforcement
- the repeated MEDIUMs were: diagnostics preservation, installed-tool
  determinism, static-analysis degradation handling, CI/docs/Pages drift, and
  architecture-scanner / boundary-assertion gaps
- active implementation phase:
  `TN-2026-04-12-03` targets the packaged-tool hook-verification HIGH first
  because it is the most contained runtime-critical blind spot in the
  converged wave
- local implementation progress:
  current uncommitted work now installs the just-built `.nupkg` into a temp
  tool path via a temp single-source `NuGet.Config`, then asserts the
  installed `.store/.../tools/*/any/hooks/` payload layout that the runtime
  hook path depends on

**Still-open ranked clusters on the latest validated pushed tip `29a526c`:**

- **HIGH: hosted CI still does not execute the Playwright E2E suite.**
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` still runs frontend unit tests plus build, but not
  `npm run test:e2e`.
- **HIGH: generated static HTML still overstates several public viewer
  features.**
  The currently shipped static viewer does not honor the documented
  `--enable-url` behavior and does not implement the advertised
  `--show-home` / `--enable-nuget-browser` / `--enable-package-upload`
  contract.
- **HIGH: the packed tool still lacks an end-to-end verification path for its
  required StartupHook payload.**
  CI verifies publish layout and installs the `.nupkg`, but it still only runs
  `inspectra --version`, so a broken packed `hooks/` layout can ship green.
  `TN-2026-04-12-03` is now addressing this locally by asserting the installed
  tool-store payload layout before the phase commit.
- **HIGH: frontend code-size policy is unenforced and already violated.**
  `CIGuidePage.tsx` is `744` lines, the repo-wide policy is not enforced for
  `.tsx`, and the frontend slice can drift past the documented hard cap without
  CI catching it.
- **MEDIUM: process and viewer failure diagnostics still discard useful
  stdout/timeout evidence.**
  `ProcessRunner.cs` and
  `Rendering/Html/Bundle/ViewerBundleProcessSupport.cs` still collapse many
  non-zero or timed-out failures to exit codes or short timeout messages even
  when stdout contains the actionable error text.
- **MEDIUM: installed-tool selection and action versioning remain
  nondeterministic.**
  Installed-tool analysis still picks the first matching
  `DotnetToolSettings.xml`, and the composite action still lets ambient
  `inspectra` on `PATH` override `inspectra-version`.
- **MEDIUM: static-analysis mode still drops help-crawl degradation signals.**
  `StaticAnalysisInstalledToolAnalysisSupport.cs` does not fail on help-crawl
  output-limit or guardrail failures the way the sibling help/CliFx analyzers
  do.
- **MEDIUM: public docs, website copy, and the CI guide still drift from the
  real product contract.**
  Current gaps include outdated CLI commands on `AboutPage`, stale CI-guide
  input coverage, README/Pages claims that no longer match deployment, and
  docs that overstate the current HTML feature-flag defaults.
- **MEDIUM: architecture enforcement is still bypassable in several places.**
  The shell/engine scanners still rely on plain `using` detection in multiple
  suites, `StartupHook` packaging-only metadata is not asserted, and some
  documented boundaries such as `Rendering.Html` vs `Rendering.Markdown` still
  lack executable coverage.
- **MEDIUM: the local Playwright suite still has stale-cache and weak-assertion
  risks even before it is wired into hosted CI.**
  The shared `.rendered` cache can mask current-output regressions, and the
  theme-toggle E2E still passes when the toggle is absent.

## Current Open Items After `a08c0f2` Fresh-Swarm Ranking (2026-04-12)

This section supersedes the older thin-shell queue-handling snapshot below now
that `g40` is pushed, `a08c0f2` is hosted validated, and the next outer
iteration has completed three fresh investigation waves plus direct local
triage.

**Current validated pushed tip and CI surface:**

- pushed branch tip: `a08c0f2`
- `dotnet test InSpectra.Gen.sln` ✅ (`325 / 0 / 0`)
- architecture filter ✅ (`17 / 0 / 0`)
- targeted engine architecture slice ✅ (`3 / 0 / 0`)
- green `pull_request` run `24297978111`
- latest green `workflow_dispatch` remains `24296167355` on `a3390bb`

**Wave summary and ranking outcome:**

- wave 1 surfaced the still-open Playwright hosted-CI HIGH, the oversized
  `CIGuidePage.tsx` HIGH, viewer stdout-diagnostics loss, docs/UI drift, and
  tooling / architecture enforcement gaps
- wave 2 added the installed-tool process-safety HIGH, strengthened the
  installed-tool determinism issue, and expanded the public-doc truthfulness
  gap
- wave 3 mostly confirmed the existing clusters while sharpening two more
  public-contract HIGHs around generated static HTML feature flags and one HIGH
  around missing StartupHook package verification
- active implementation pick:
  `TN-2026-04-12-02` targets the installed-tool process-safety cluster first
  because it closes a runtime HIGH with a contained write set

**Open HIGH findings after ranking:**

- **HIGH: installed-tool help/hook crawls still scope process cleanup to the
  caller working directory instead of engine-managed sandbox state.**
  The help/crawling and hook paths still feed the caller workspace into
  `CommandProcessSupport.TerminateSandboxProcesses(...)` through the
  `sandboxRoot` channel, so cancellation cleanup can escape the intended
  sandbox boundary.
- **HIGH: hosted CI still does not execute the Playwright E2E suite.**
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` still runs frontend unit tests plus build, but not
  `npm run test:e2e`.
- **HIGH: generated static HTML still overstates several public viewer
  features.**
  The currently shipped static viewer does not honor the documented
  `--enable-url` behavior and does not implement the advertised
  `--show-home` / `--enable-nuget-browser` / `--enable-package-upload`
  contract.
- **HIGH: the packed tool still lacks an end-to-end verification path for its
  required StartupHook payload.**
  CI verifies publish layout and installs the `.nupkg`, but it still only runs
  `inspectra --version`, so a broken packed `hooks/` layout can ship green.
- **HIGH: frontend code-size policy is unenforced and already violated.**
  `CIGuidePage.tsx` is `744` lines, the repo-wide policy is not enforced for
  `.tsx`, and the frontend slice can drift past the documented hard cap without
  CI catching it.

**Open MEDIUM findings after ranking:**

- **MEDIUM: process and viewer failure diagnostics still discard useful
  stdout/timeout evidence.**
  `ProcessRunner.cs` and
  `Rendering/Html/Bundle/ViewerBundleProcessSupport.cs` still collapse many
  non-zero or timed-out failures to exit codes or short timeout messages even
  when stdout contains the actionable error text.
- **MEDIUM: installed-tool selection and action versioning remain
  nondeterministic.**
  Installed-tool analysis still picks the first matching
  `DotnetToolSettings.xml`, and the composite action still lets ambient
  `inspectra` on `PATH` override `inspectra-version`.
- **MEDIUM: static-analysis mode still drops help-crawl degradation signals.**
  `StaticAnalysisInstalledToolAnalysisSupport.cs` does not fail on help-crawl
  output-limit or guardrail failures the way the sibling help/CliFx analyzers
  do.
- **MEDIUM: public docs, website copy, and the CI guide still drift from the
  real product contract.**
  Current gaps include outdated CLI commands on `AboutPage`, stale CI-guide
  input coverage, README/Pages claims that no longer match deployment, and
  docs that overstate the current HTML feature-flag defaults.
- **MEDIUM: architecture enforcement is still bypassable in several places.**
  The shell/engine scanners still rely on plain `using` detection in multiple
  suites, `StartupHook` packaging-only metadata is not asserted, and some
  documented boundaries such as `Rendering.Html` vs `Rendering.Markdown` still
  lack executable coverage.
- **MEDIUM: the local Playwright suite still has stale-cache and weak-assertion
  risks even before it is wired into hosted CI.**
  The shared `.rendered` cache can mask current-output regressions, and the
  theme-toggle E2E still passes when the toggle is absent.

**Open LOW findings after ranking:**

- no new LOW findings were surfaced by the fresh swarms
- the prior LOW-only ledger below still remains in force and should continue to
  be aggregated rather than re-raised as blocking work

## Current Open Items After Thin-Shell Queue Handling (2026-04-12)

This section supersedes the older iteration-7 snapshot below now that
`TN-2026-04-12-01` has landed locally in `g40`.

**Current local validation surface:**

- `dotnet test InSpectra.Gen.sln` ✅ (`160 / 0 / 0`
  `InSpectra.Gen.Engine.Tests`, `165 / 0 / 0` `InSpectra.Gen.Tests`)
- `dotnet test tests/InSpectra.Gen.Tests/InSpectra.Gen.Tests.csproj --filter Architecture --no-restore`
  ✅ (`17 / 0 / 0`)
- targeted engine architecture slice ✅ (`3 / 0 / 0`)

**Queue-handling work already closed locally:**

- `TN-2026-04-12-01` is complete on `g40` (`8b3c0bc`)
- the old `Rendering.Contracts` → `Pipeline` leak is gone; public render
  services now depend on internal pipeline types only, and
  `AcquiredRenderDocument` / `IDocumentRenderService` are no longer exposed as
  public engine surface
- the engine rename is now reflected in code, tests, and architecture docs;
  the backend project/test assembly now read as `InSpectra.Gen.Engine` and
  `InSpectra.Gen.Engine.Tests`
- engine implementation types and submodule DI seams that became public during
  the rename have been collapsed back to `internal`, and
  `ArchitectureEnginePublicSurfaceTests` now guards the exported engine surface
- internal layering coverage now includes shell `Output/` plus engine
  `Execution/` and `Targets/` roots, so those checks are no longer grep-only
- engine result and exception flows no longer embed shell-flag wording like
  `--out-dir`, `--overwrite`, `--crawl-out`, or `--cli-framework`

**Open HIGH/MEDIUM findings still pending the next fresh swarm:**

- **HIGH: CI still does not run the Playwright E2E suite.**
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` still does not execute `npm run test:e2e`, so the
  UI E2E coverage under `src/InSpectra.UI/e2e/` is not part of hosted CI.
- **MEDIUM: viewer-build failures still lose stdout diagnostics.**
  `src/InSpectra.Gen.Engine/Rendering/Html/Bundle/ViewerBundleProcessSupport.cs`
  still reports only stderr on failure.
- **MEDIUM: multi-TFM installed-dotnet-tool resolution is still nondeterministic.**
  `src/InSpectra.Gen.Engine/Tooling/Process/InstalledDotnetToolCommandSupport.cs`
  still returns the first matching `DotnetToolSettings.xml` under the install
  tree, so enumeration order can pick the wrong entry point/runtimeconfig.
- **MEDIUM: docs/UI still drift from the action and Pages behavior.**
  `README.md` still advertises example bundles that the Pages jobs do not
  publish, and `src/InSpectra.UI/src/components/CIGuidePage.tsx` still omits
  multiple inputs present in `.github/actions/render/action.yml`.
- **MEDIUM: app-shell architecture scanning is still regex-limited.**
  `tests/InSpectra.Gen.Tests/Architecture/ArchitectureAppShellTests.cs` can
  still miss fully-qualified, alias, or `global using static` dependency
  edges, even though the new exported-surface guard now blocks many of the
  worst regressions.

## Retrospective (executed 2026-04-11)

This section is self-contained: a reader should be able to understand
exactly what shipped without running `git log`, `git show`, or opening any
other file. Every SHA is anchored to an inline summary of what it changed.

### Iteration-by-iteration findings and dispositions

#### Iteration 1

Spawned 7 parallel read-only investigators (S1 structural, S2 layering, S3
composition, S4 type/API, S5 docs/tests, S6 architecture-test coverage
gaps, S7 StartupHook + InSpectra.UI).

**Aggregated HIGH/BLOCKER findings acted on:**

- **7 × `*Models.cs` dumping grounds**, including one inside a forbidden
  `Models/` subfolder one level deep in a mode subtree. Concrete files:
  - `src/InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition/Modes/Static/Models/StaticAnalysisModels.cs`
    — 3 records (`StaticCommandDefinition`, `StaticOptionDefinition`,
    `StaticValueDefinition`). **Also** lived inside a forbidden
    `Modes/Static/Models/` folder, which the charter bans at any depth
    (F4 had already fixed the parallel case in `Modes/Hook/Models/`).
  - `src/InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition/Modes/CliFx/Metadata/CliFxMetadataModels.cs`
    — 5 records (`CliFxCommandDefinition`, `CliFxParameterDefinition`,
    `CliFxOptionDefinition`, `CliFxHelpDocument`, `CliFxHelpItem`).
  - `src/InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition/Tooling/Introspection/IntrospectionModels.cs`
    — 2 records (`JsonParseResult`, `IntrospectionOutcome`, where
    `IntrospectionOutcome` carries a `ToStepMetadata(...)` helper
    method).
  - `src/InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition/Tooling/Packages/PackageInspectionModels.cs`
    — 2 records (`SpectrePackageInspection` with an `Empty` static
    factory + `HasToolAssemblyReferencing*` methods,
    `SpectreAssemblyVersionInfo`).
  - `src/InSpectra.Gen.StartupHook/Capture/CaptureModels.cs` — 4 JSON
    DTO classes (`CaptureResult`, `CapturedCommand`, `CapturedOption`,
    `CapturedArgument`). Important because the acquisition-side Hook
    mode already had each equivalent type in its own file under
    `Modes/Hook/Capture/` after F4 — these are the producer-side twins
    of those consumer-side types and should match the 1-type-per-file
    convention.
  - `src/InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition/Tooling/NuGet/NuGetApiModels.cs` —
    21 NuGet V3 domain DTOs (tightly-coupled cluster).
  - `src/InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition/Tooling/NuGet/NuGetApiSpecModels.cs` —
    21 NuGet V3 wire-format DTOs with `[JsonPropertyName]` attributes
    (tightly-coupled cluster).

- **Gap: no architecture test for Gen-internal layering cycles.** The
  charter directions `Commands → UseCases → Rendering → OpenCli → Core`
  were enforced only by the ad-hoc grep ritual baked into the F2 commit
  body. Nothing prevented re-introduction of the 3 cycles F2 had just
  fixed.

- **Gap: README.md Project Layout listed only 2 source projects and 1
  test project**, missing `InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition`,
  `InSpectra.Gen.Core`, `InSpectra.Gen.StartupHook`, and
  `tests/InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition.Tests/`. (This gap was initially
  flagged in iteration 1 S4 but de-prioritized behind structural work;
  it was re-raised and fixed in iteration 3.)

**Aggregated false positives rejected (important — a future iteration
should not re-raise these without reading the reasoning):**

- **S3: "`OpenCliNormalizer` is registered by `AddInSpectraRendering`
  but actually belongs to the OpenCli module."** Rejected. Phase f2
  explicitly moved `OpenCliNormalizer.cs` **from**
  `src/InSpectra.Gen/OpenCli/Enrichment/` **to**
  `src/InSpectra.Gen/Rendering/Pipeline/` to break a charter-violating
  `OpenCli → Rendering` cycle — the normalizer produces
  `NormalizedCliDocument`, a flat form shaped for rendering consumption,
  so it belongs to rendering. Moving it back would re-introduce the
  cycle the phase g3 tests now guard against.
- **S4: "`OpenCliXmlEnricher.cs` is a multi-type file."** Rejected. The
  two "extra" types at lines 177 and 184 are `private sealed class
  XmlCommandInfo` / `private sealed class XmlParameterInfo` — nested
  private helpers inside the enricher class, not top-level declarations.
  Category 6 only targets unrelated top-level types.
- **S6: "`ArchitectureModeTests.No_cross_mode_dependencies` is vacuously
  green because `Modes/` doesn't exist in `InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition`."**
  Rejected. The test explicitly asserts
  `Directory.Exists(ModesRoot)` before iterating, and the folder does
  exist with 4 subfolders (`CliFx`, `Help`, `Hook`, `Static`). The
  investigator had searched the wrong project root.
- **S7: "StartupHook has thread-safety BLOCKERs — `SystemCommandLineAssembly`
  and `CapturePath` are plain fields."** Downgraded to pre-existing LOW.
  `git blame` showed both fields have been plain `internal static` since
  the initial migrate commit (`c1e09b4`). The commit message of
  `1789504` **stated** it would "convert internal static fields
  (`CapturePath`, `SystemCommandLineAssembly`, `FrameworkAssembly`) to
  `Volatile.Read/Write`-backed properties", but `git show 1789504` shows
  the diff only touched `_captured`/`_patched` flags and `ConcurrentBag`
  — the field conversion was never actually performed. These fields are
  written in `Install()` exactly once and read from Harmony postfixes
  and `ProcessExit`, which run strictly after `Install()` returns; the
  happens-before relationship from event subscription is practical
  enough that no live test has ever failed on this. Iteration 1
  deliberately left it alone because it's not a regression and fixing
  it is out of scope for "smells introduced since `5f9f894`".

**Iteration 1 intentional defers:**

- `MarkdownRenderService.cs:74,118,161` — sync `File.WriteAllText` inside
  `HandleSingleLayout` / `HandleTreeLayout` / `HandleHybridLayout`.
  These are private methods called from the public `RenderFromFileAsync`
  (line 13, `public async Task<RenderExecutionResult>`). Fix requires
  making the private methods `async`, threading a `CancellationToken`
  through all three signatures, and changing the outer `Render(...)`
  dispatcher to `async`. That crosses into feature-change territory
  (changes continuation behavior and cancellation semantics) — out of
  scope for "no feature work".
- `HtmlBundleComposer.cs:48,54,92,127,163` — 5 sync `File.ReadAllText` /
  `File.Exists` calls in static helpers invoked from
  `HtmlRenderService.RenderAsync`. Same reasoning.

#### Iteration 2

**Iteration 2 skipped its own fresh investigation swarm** and reused the
iteration-1 validation swarm's findings. Justification: iteration-1
verifier V2/6 (charter-alignment) ran the authoritative multi-type scan
(keyed on type count, not filename) across the entire `src/` tree as
part of validating g1's output. That scan surfaced **24 additional
multi-type files** that the g1 investigation's filename-based grep had
missed. Running a fresh iteration-2 investigation swarm would have
produced the same list.

**The critical insight from that scan:** five of the 24 hits were
service-style filenames whose body actually declared a service class +
2 DTO records. They looked structurally identical to the `*Models.cs`
dumping grounds but could not have been found by filename grep:

- `src/InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition/Modes/Hook/Execution/HookToolProcessInvocationResolver.cs`
  — 1 static class + `HookToolProcessInvocation` record +
  `HookToolProcessInvocationResolution` record (the resolution wraps an
  invocation and carries `FromInvocation` / `TerminalFailure` factory
  methods). F4 had moved this file into `Modes/Hook/Execution/` from
  its original `Modes/Hook/` flat location but had not split its 3
  types — a direct continuation of the F4 cleanup.
- `src/InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition/Tooling/Tools/ToolDescriptorResolver.cs`
  — `IToolDescriptorResolver` interface + `ToolDescriptorResolution`
  record (carrying `ToolDescriptor Descriptor` + `SpectrePackageInspection
  Inspection`) + `ToolDescriptorResolver` sealed class.
- `src/InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition/Tooling/Process/DotnetRuntimeCompatibilitySupport.cs`
  — `DotnetRuntimeCompatibilitySupport` `static partial class` (the
  `partial` is load-bearing because the class uses a `[GeneratedRegex]`
  source generator) + `DotnetRuntimeIssue` record + `DotnetRuntimeRequirement`
  record.
- `src/InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition/Tooling/Packages/DotnetToolSettingsReader.cs`
  — `DotnetToolSettingsReader` static class + `DotnetToolSettingsDocument`
  record + `DotnetToolSettingsCommand` record.
- `src/InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition/Tooling/DocumentPipeline/Structure/OpenCliCommandTreeBuilder.cs`
  — `OpenCliCommandTreeBuilder` sealed class + `OpenCliCommandDescriptor`
  record + `OpenCliCommandTreeNode` record (carrying an init-only
  `Children` property used via `with` in the builder's recursive
  `BuildNodes`).

**Two more files were split** where the DTO had cross-folder or
cross-project usage, making inline-coupling untenable:

- `src/InSpectra.Gen/Execution/Process/ProcessRunner.cs` declared
  both the `public sealed class ProcessRunner : IProcessRunner` and the
  `public sealed record ProcessResult(string StandardOutput, string
  StandardError)`. `ProcessResult` was referenced from 6 files across
  both `InSpectra.Gen` (via `IProcessRunner`) and
  `InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition` (`CliFxHelpCrawler`, `Crawler`,
  `CapturePayloadSupport`, `HookFailureMessageSupport`,
  `HookInstalledToolAnalysisSupport`). A public DTO used this widely
  cannot hide in another file.
- `src/InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition/Tooling/FrameworkDetection/CliFrameworkProvider.cs`
  declared both `CliFrameworkProvider` (the provider record carrying
  `LabelAliases`/`DependencyIds`/etc.) and `StaticAnalysisFrameworkAdapter`
  (the type-erasure carrier with `object Reader`). The adapter was
  referenced by `CliFrameworkProviderRegistry` and
  `StaticAnalysisAssemblyInspectionSupport` independently, and carries
  a multi-paragraph doc comment explaining the phase-2a type-erasure
  rationale (avoiding `Tooling → Modes` compile dependency) — that
  rationale travels with the type when it gets its own file.

**22 × 2-type files deliberately left inline** — documented at length in
the g5 commit message because they all share the same "tight inline
cluster" exception:

1. **`Contracts/Providers/*.cs`** (4 files): each pairs an interface
   with its immediate result DTO — `ICliFrameworkCatalog` +
   `CliFrameworkCatalogEntry`, `ILocalCliFrameworkDetector` +
   `LocalCliFrameworkDetection`, `IPackageCliToolInstaller` +
   `PackageCliToolInstallation`, `IAcquisitionAnalysisDispatcher` +
   `CliTargetDescriptor` + `AcquisitionAnalysisOutcome`. Deliberate
   design from step 11 — splitting would produce 8+ files for a layer
   with only 4 providers, offering no clarity win.
2. **Static support classes + their result record** (7 files under
   `Tooling/`): `ApplicationLifetime.cs` + `NuGetApiClientScope`,
   `Tooling/Results/ResultSupport.cs` + `DetectionInfo`,
   `Tooling/Packages/Archive/PackageArchivePortableExecutableSupport.cs` +
   `PackageArchiveAssemblyInspection`,
   `Tooling/DocumentPipeline/Documents/OpenCliMetrics.cs` +
   `OpenCliMetricsResult`,
   `Tooling/Process/InstalledDotnetToolCommandSupport.cs` +
   `InstalledDotnetToolCommand`,
   `Tooling/Process/CommandInstallationSupport.cs` +
   `InstalledToolContext`, `Tooling/Packages/DotnetToolPackageLayout.cs`
   + builder. Each result type has **zero external consumers** — grep
   count of 1 (the owning file itself).
3. **Mode-private parser/classifier + intermediate record** (9 files):
   `CliFxCommandTreeBuilder.cs` + `CliFxCommandNode`,
   `CliFxCoverageClassifier.cs` + `CliFxCoverageSummary`,
   `CliFxHelpCrawler.cs` + `CliFxCaptureSummary`,
   `CommandScopedSectionSupport.cs` + `CommandScopedSectionParseResult`,
   `UsagePrototypeSupport.cs` + `UsagePrototype`,
   `DnlibAssemblyScanner.cs` + `ScannedModule`,
   `StaticAnalysisAssemblyInspectionSupport.cs` +
   `StaticAnalysisAssemblyInspectionResult`,
   `StaticAnalysisCoverageClassifier.cs` + `StaticAnalysisCoverageSummary`,
   `StaticAnalysisModuleSelectionSupport.cs` + `ScannedModuleMetadata`.
4. **Single-file DTO + builder**:
   `Tooling/Packages/DotnetToolPackageLayout.cs` (record + builder
   class, tightly paired).
5. **Wire-layer converter helper pair**:
   `Tooling/NuGet/NuGetApiSpecConverters.cs` — 2 `JsonConverter<>`
   classes that exist solely to wire NuGet's V3 JSON oddities into the
   spec DTOs.
6. **Dispatcher + file-private `IDisposable` helper**:
   `Orchestration/AcquisitionAnalysisDispatcher.cs` +
   `TemporaryAnalysisWorkspace`.
7. **Intentionally-coupled sealed hierarchies (2 files)**:
   `Modes/Static/Attributes/SystemCommandLine/SystemCommandLineMethodValues.cs`
   declares `internal abstract class MethodValue;` plus 9 concrete
   variants (`StringValue`, `Int32Value`, `StringArrayValue`,
   `OptionValue`, `ArgumentValue`, `CommandValue` with a full
   child-command tree, `NullValue`, `CurrentMethodInstanceValue`,
   `UnknownValue`). This is a closed discriminated union — splitting
   hurts readability because the whole case analysis lives together.
   `SystemCommandLineConstructorValues.cs` follows the same shape with
   `ConstructorValue` + 8 `record` variants.
8. **Related static-constant vocabulary**:
   `Contracts/AnalysisConstants.cs` — three `public static class`es
   (`AnalysisMode`, `AnalysisDisposition`, `ResultKey`) that collectively
   form the enum-like mode vocabulary for the whole acquisition layer.

#### Iteration 3

Spawned a fresh 6-agent swarm (S1 structural, S2 layering, S3 StartupHook,
S4 docs drift, S5 test hygiene, S6 API smells).

**Only 1 HIGH finding, 0 BLOCKERs.** After g1–g5, the tree was
structurally and architecturally clean. The single HIGH was the stale
README Project Layout section that had been de-prioritized in iteration
1. S6 surfaced a NEW MEDIUM (sync I/O in `HtmlRenderService.cs`) of the
same shape as the iteration-1 deferred finding; defer reason is
identical.

**Iteration 3 deferrals:**

- `HtmlRenderService.cs:103–106,137–139` — sync `Directory.CreateDirectory`,
  `File.Copy`, `Directory.Delete`, `Directory.EnumerateFileSystemEntries`
  inside the public `RenderAsync` method. Same reasoning as the
  iteration-1 `MarkdownRenderService` defer: converting to async
  requires threading `CancellationToken` through the helper chain and
  would change thread-scheduling behavior.

#### Iteration 4

Spawned a fresh 6-agent swarm on top of the post-`g9` tree (structural,
dependency/layering, async-I/O/API, docs/test hygiene, dead code/fixtures,
StartupHook/special cases). The user also clarified the reporting rule:
LOW findings must still be aggregated even though only BLOCKER/HIGH/MEDIUM
gate the stop condition.

**Accepted HIGH/MEDIUM findings acted on or queued into the ledger refresh:**

- **HIGH: dead sync asset-catalog helpers left behind by g7.**
  `src/InSpectra.Gen/Rendering/Html/Bundle/HtmlBundleComposer.cs` still
  exposed `CollectReferencedAssets(...)`, forwarding to the synchronous
  helper in `HtmlBundleAssetComposer.cs`, but the current tree only called
  the async collector from `HtmlRenderService`. The sync pair had become
  orphaned dead code during the render async-boundary refactor.
- **MEDIUM: `ArchitectureModeTests.cs` still had a vacuous-green hole and a
  shallow `OpenCli` folder scan.** `No_cross_mode_dependencies()` only
  asserted that `Modes/` existed; it did not assert that any source files
  were scanned or that the scanned surface still contained
  `InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition.Modes.*` namespaces. The sibling
  `Mode_specific_OpenCli_folders_are_renamed_to_Projection()` only
  enumerated immediate child directories under each mode, so a deeper
  `Modes/<Mode>/**/OpenCli/` regression would have slipped through.
- **MEDIUM: the old monolithic follow-up ledger was stale after g7–g10.**
  The status banner, phase summary, deferred-findings list, and final test
  counts still described the pre-g7 tree and re-listed render-path async-I/O
  debt that g7 had already fixed.

**Fresh swarm findings explicitly rejected (do not re-raise without stronger
evidence):**

- **Broad `Output.Json` / `Targets/*` layering claims from the dependency
  swarm.** Rejected for this follow-up run. Those reports leaned on the
  historical target-state in `docs/Tasks/Restructure/Task.md` rather than the
  self-contained smell categories in this file and did not demonstrate a
  current stop-condition violation inside the accepted follow-up surfaces.
- **"Add a StartupHook boundary scanner to `ArchitectureAppShellTests` right
  now."** Rejected for iteration 4. A quick verifier pass showed that the
  obvious regex-based version was both over-broad relative to the charter's
  "startup-hook integration" allowance and still trivially bypassable. It was
  reverted rather than landing a half-correct enforcement rule.
- **"Add `Output ⊄ UseCases` / `Execution ⊄ Rendering` facts to
  `ArchitectureGenInternalLayeringTests` right now."** Rejected for iteration
  4. The existing scanner only understands local `using` directives, while
  the repo already exposes these surfaces via `GlobalUsings.cs`; the naive
  addition would therefore pass green without seeing real uses. These edges
  remain grep-only future work exactly as documented below.

**LOW findings aggregated and left open:**

- **Filename/type drift** remains in four current files:
  `Modes/CliFx/Execution/CliFxToolRuntime.cs` (`CliFxRuntime`),
  `Modes/Static/Inspection/StaticAnalysisToolRuntime.cs`
  (`StaticAnalysisRuntime`),
  `Modes/Static/Inspection/StaticAnalysisInstalledToolAnalysisSupport.cs`
  (`StaticInstalledToolAnalysisSupport`), and
  `tests/InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition.Tests/SystemCommandLine/SystemCommandLineConstructorTestModuleBuilder.cs`
  (`ConstructorReaderTestModuleBuilder`).
- **StartupHook thread-safety publication** remains LOW-only and
  pre-existing in the 4 patch installers / interceptors already documented in
  the false-positive notes and defers below.
- **`CaptureFileWriter.TryReadStatusCore` still has a bare catch that returns
  null**, which hides malformed capture files instead of surfacing a
  structured diagnostic.
- **Comment-only live-test skip catalogs** remain in
  `ValidatedGenericHelpFrameworkCases.cs` and
  `CommandLineUtilsHookLiveTests.cs`; the skipped cases are intentional today
  but still lack a concrete tracker reference.

#### Iteration 5

Started from the post-`g10` tree with three already-landed follow-ups
(`g11`–`g13`) and then ran a fresh investigation/implementation loop that
shipped `g14`–`g20`.

**Accepted HIGH/MEDIUM findings acted on:**

- **MEDIUM: the remaining async file-loading boundary still used synchronous
  preflight checks** in `OpenCliDocumentLoader.cs`,
  `OpenCliXmlEnricher.cs`, and `DocumentRenderService.cs`. Phase `g14`
  removed the remaining sync `File.Exists` prechecks while preserving the
  existing `CliUsageException` contract for missing paths, directory paths,
  and pre-cancelled missing inputs.
- **HIGH: dead acquisition helper tail remained after the earlier refactors.**
  `Tooling/Introspection/*` and `Tooling/Json/JsonDocumentStabilitySupport.cs`
  had no remaining repo-local callers. Phase `g15` deleted the orphaned code.
- **MEDIUM: artifact emission on the async acquisition path was still
  synchronous.** `OpenCliArtifactWriter` wrote OpenCLI/crawl payloads with
  synchronous file I/O from async acquisition flows. Phase `g16` moved this to
  async staged writes, threaded `CancellationToken` through the result
  factory/callers, and preserved path-validation behavior. Phase `g18` then
  hardened the edge cases the verifier loop found: staged temp-file cleanup,
  commit-time overwrite enforcement, rollback after second-artifact publish
  failure, and non-destructive backup cleanup.
- **MEDIUM: packaged viewer bundles were still unreachable or inconsistently
  ranked in mixed repo+packaged states.** `ViewerBundleLocator` still let a
  nearby checkout pre-empt the shipped bundle too eagerly. Phase `g17`
  restored packaged-first mixed-state precedence and split the oversized test
  matrix into focused files. Phase `g18` then aligned the stale-bundle
  fallback edge cases the verifier loop surfaced, so rebuild failures now fall
  back to the newest available stale bundle rather than blindly downgrading to
  the packaged copy.
- **MEDIUM: the indexed NuGet live tests were trivially green.**
  `NuGetApiClientLiveTests` returned early whenever `index/packages/` was
  absent, and neither the repo nor CI materialized that dataset. Phase `g19`
  made the tests fail fast when fixtures are missing and added a tracked
  `latest/metadata.json` sample set for four stable dotnet-tool packages so
  the CI live slice actually executes. Phase `g20` added the matching
  versioned fixtures for the optional `INSPECTRA_GEN_LIVE_NUGET_SCOPE=all`
  path.
- **MEDIUM: the monolithic follow-up ledger was stale after `g10`.** The
  status banner, phase table, local test counts, and open-item list all still
  described the post-`g10` tree. This refresh closes that last accepted
  MEDIUM from the post-`g20` committed tree.

**Fresh swarm findings explicitly rejected (do not re-raise without stronger
evidence):**

- **`OpenCliNormalizer` placement, `OpenCliXmlEnricher` nested classes, the
  old `ArchitectureModeTests` vacuous-green claim, and the pre-existing
  StartupHook publication issue** remain the same rejected/LOW-only cases
  already documented above; iteration 5 did not discover any new evidence that
  changes those dispositions.
- **Broad `Output` / `Execution` / `Targets/*` ownership complaints** were
  re-inspected and still rejected as stop-condition findings for this follow-up
  run. The current tree still does not provide stronger charter-grounded proof
  than the earlier rejected reports.
- **"Fresh packaged bundle should never suppress a repo rebuild"** was
  rejected for the mixed-state viewer flow. The accepted defect was that a
  nearby checkout could make the shipped packaged bundle unreachable. When the
  packaged bundle is not stale relative to the frontend inputs, keeping it as
  the preferred result is the deliberate packaged-first behavior.
- **"Mixed-state `allowBuild: false` should still throw when repo `dist` is
  missing"** was rejected. In the packaged+repo case, the accepted fix is to
  use the shipped packaged bundle instead of treating the nearby checkout as an
  authoritative failure source.
- **"Any nearby repo can maliciously force npm build execution via mtime-based
  staleness"** was rejected as a stop-condition smell. `ViewerBundleLocator`
  intentionally treats a local checkout as an optional override surface; this
  is an operator-trust / CLI-behavior concern, not a new architectural smell
  relative to the charter and prior follow-up categories.

**LOW findings aggregated and left open after iteration 5:**

- The four residual filename/type drifts listed under iteration 4 remain
  LOW-only and were not touched by `g14`–`g20`.
- The pre-existing `StartupHook` publication LOW and the
  `CaptureFileWriter.TryReadStatusCore` bare catch remain unchanged.
- The comment-only live-test skip catalogs in
  `ValidatedGenericHelpFrameworkCases.cs` and
  `CommandLineUtilsHookLiveTests.cs` remain LOW-only.
- `StartupHook/Capture/CaptureFileWriter.cs` still carries the untracked
  TFM-upgrade TODO about switching to `DefaultIgnoreCondition` once the target
  framework is raised. Valid LOW, not stop-condition work.

#### Iteration 6

Started from the refreshed post-`g20` tree. A fresh six-agent swarm then
found one more dead acquisition helper/API tail, one hook-retry correctness
bug, one architecture/CI coverage hole cluster, and one public CI
workflow/docs contract drift cluster. Those findings shipped as `g21`–`g24`.

**Accepted HIGH/MEDIUM findings acted on:**

- **HIGH: dead acquisition helper/API tail still remained after `g15`.**
  `JsonPayloadRepair.cs` had no remaining repo-local callers, and
  `JsonNodeFileLoader` plus the old top-level
  `Tooling/Process/{RuntimeSupport,ProcessResult,SandboxEnvironment}` stack
  still carried dead duplicate surfaces. Phase `g21` deleted the dead files
  and collapsed `JsonNodeFileLoader` to the one live `TryLoadJsonObject(...)`
  entrypoint.
- **MEDIUM: hook retries could treat a stale undeleted capture file as fresh
  output.** `HookProcessRetrySupport` reused one `INSPECTRA_CAPTURE_PATH`
  across compatibility/help retries, so a locked stale capture could
  short-circuit retry decisions. Phase `g22` gave each retry attempt its own
  isolated capture path and only publishes the final chosen capture back to
  the requested output path.
- **MEDIUM: backend architecture/CI coverage still had two vacuous-green
  holes.** `ArchitectureProjectDependencyTests` silently ignored any backend
  `.csproj` that was missing from its charter map, and the Windows-only backend
  tests were counted as passing on the main Ubuntu CI lane without executing.
  Phase `g23` made the project-dependency test require exact charter coverage,
  restored a positive-scan anchor to the forbidden-buckets test, tagged the
  Windows-specific tests explicitly, and added a dedicated Windows CI job for
  that slice while excluding it from the Ubuntu lane.
- **HIGH/MEDIUM: the public CI workflow/docs contract had drifted.** The
  reusable workflow docs claimed the wrapper exposed the same surface as the
  action even though `title`, `command-prefix`, and caller-controlled
  `output-dir` were not actually forwarded, and the published action docs were
  still missing `markdown-hybrid`, `split-depth`, and the current HTML option
  surface. Phase `g24` aligned the reusable workflow to the documented action
  surface for the missing passthrough inputs and refreshed `README.md` +
  `docs/CI/*` to the current action/workflow contract.

**Fresh swarm findings explicitly rejected (do not re-raise without stronger
evidence):**

- **The remaining `JsonNodeFileLoader` catch-all behavior** is valid LOW
  hygiene debt, not another dead-surface HIGH once `g21` lands. The accepted
  defect was the dead API tail, not the surviving live `TryLoadJsonObject(...)`
  behavior.
- **Best-effort cleanup catches elsewhere are not equivalent to the
  `HookProcessRetrySupport` defect.** The accepted `g22` bug was specifically
  that stale capture files fed later retry control flow. Other post-outcome
  cleanup catches that do not influence later decisions remain outside the
  stop condition.
- **Live-test gating behind `INSPECTRA_GEN_LIVE_TESTS=1` remains intentional.**
  The accepted hosted-coverage defect in this iteration was the Ubuntu lane's
  vacuous handling of Windows-only unit tests, not the separate live-test
  environment gate that the dedicated live CI job explicitly sets.
- **The older false positives already documented in iterations 4–5** remain
  rejected: `OpenCliNormalizer` placement, `OpenCliXmlEnricher` nested classes,
  the old `ArchitectureModeTests` vacuous claim, the pre-existing StartupHook
  publication issue, and the broader `Output` / `Execution` / `Targets/*`
  ownership complaints still have no stronger current-tree evidence.

**LOW findings aggregated and left open after iteration 6:**

- The four residual filename/type drifts listed under iteration 5 remain
  LOW-only and were not touched by `g21`–`g24`.
- The pre-existing `StartupHook` publication LOW and the
  `CaptureFileWriter.TryReadStatusCore` bare catch remain unchanged.
- The comment-only live-test skip catalogs in
  `ValidatedGenericHelpFrameworkCases.cs` and
  `CommandLineUtilsHookLiveTests.cs` remain LOW-only.
- `StartupHook/Capture/CaptureFileWriter.cs` still carries the untracked
  TFM-upgrade TODO about switching to `DefaultIgnoreCondition` once the target
  framework is raised. Valid LOW, not stop-condition work.
- Several module-local implementation types remain public even though they are
  composed behind abstractions (for example `OpenCliGenerationService`,
  `DocumentRenderService`, and `ProcessRunner`). Valid LOW API-surface debt,
  but not stop-condition work.
- `JsonNodeFileLoader.TryLoadJsonObject(...)` still collapses parse/I/O
  failures to `null`, and `HtmlRenderService` still does unnecessary bundle
  enumeration before the `--single-file --dry-run` fast path. Both remain LOW.

#### Iteration 7

Started from the refreshed post-`g24` tree. This final user-directed outer
iteration ran repeated fresh investigations plus per-phase verifier swarms and
shipped `g25`–`g39`.

**Accepted HIGH/MEDIUM findings acted on:**

- **MEDIUM: hook retries could still discard the only surviving capture when
  final publication failed.** Phase `g25` kept the surviving per-attempt
  capture path, surfaced it to the caller, and taught installed-tool analysis
  to deserialize from that effective path instead of assuming the requested
  capture path existed.
- **HIGH/MEDIUM: the public CI/action/docs contract still drifted.** Phase
  `g26` corrected `markdown-hybrid` verification wording, documented
  compression-level-2 HTML output accurately, and aligned the action/workflow
  docs with the real runtime surface; phase `g37` later tightened workflow
  permissions, excluded live tests from the general lane, and aligned package
  mode xmldoc handling plus the UI guide with the same published contract.
- **MEDIUM: several Acquisition service files still hid cross-file DTO/helper
  types inline.** Phases `g27`, `g28`, and `g36` extracted the remaining
  shared CliFx, archive-inspection, static-analysis, and dotnet-package-layout
  leaf records/helpers whose consumers had crossed file boundaries and no
  longer fit the g5 file-private exception.
- **MEDIUM: app-shell/global-using drift still masked real dependency
  ownership.** Phases `g29`, `g30`, `g33`, `g34`, and `g38` first localized
  imports in command, generate, OpenCli, and rendering entry points, then
  removed `src/InSpectra.Gen/GlobalUsings.cs` entirely and added a guard
  against internal project-wide `global using InSpectra.Gen.*` directives in
  the app shell.
- **HIGH: generate/render publication paths were still not fully
  transactional.** Phase `g31` staged `generate` output plus requested
  OpenCLI/crawl artifacts as one transaction; phase `g32` staged HTML and
  Markdown render outputs before publishing; and verifier-driven phase `g39`
  closed the remaining existing-empty-directory hole so directory publication
  stays transactional even when the destination already exists but is empty.
- **HIGH: HTML bundle publication still only proved bundle presence, not
  bundle completeness.** Phase `g39` now rejects incomplete viewer bundles
  when `static.html` references missing assets, preventing broken `index.html`
  publication.
- **MEDIUM: rendering still depended on `Execution.Process` for viewer bundle
  builds.** Phase `g35` localized npm/process launch support under rendering
  ownership and removed that layer leak.

**Fresh swarm findings explicitly rejected (do not re-raise without stronger
evidence):**

- **The mixed-state viewer fallback after repo build failure remains the
  intentional `g17`/`g18` behavior.** The accepted defect was packaged-bundle
  reachability and stale-bundle precedence in specific mixed states; "fallback
  must always fail or warn instead" was not accepted as a new current-tree
  HIGH in this iteration.
- **The previously documented false positives remain rejected** and should not
  be resurfaced without new proof: `OpenCliNormalizer` placement,
  `OpenCliXmlEnricher` nested classes, the old `ArchitectureModeTests`
  vacuous-green claim, and the pre-existing StartupHook publication issue.

**Fresh post-`g38` swarm findings still open after `g39`:**

- **HIGH: CI still does not execute the Playwright E2E suite.**
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` does not run `npm run test:e2e` even though the
  repo ships UI E2E coverage under `src/InSpectra.UI/e2e/`.
- **MEDIUM: viewer-build failures surface stderr only.**
  `ViewerBundleProcessSupport.RunProcessAsync()` drops stdout on failure,
  making frontend build diagnostics incomplete.
- **MEDIUM: installed-dotnet-tool command resolution is nondeterministic for
  multi-TFM tools.** `InstalledDotnetToolCommandSupport.TryResolve()` returns
  the first matching `DotnetToolSettings.xml` under the install tree, so
  enumeration order can pick the wrong entry point/runtimeconfig.
- **MEDIUM: rendering contracts still leak a pipeline concrete.**
  `IDocumentRenderService` exposes `AcquiredRenderDocument`, which lives under
  `Rendering.Pipeline`.
- **MEDIUM: public docs/UI still drift from the shipped action surface.**
  `README.md` still advertises published example bundles that the Pages jobs do
  not actually publish, and `src/InSpectra.UI/src/components/CIGuidePage.tsx`
  still omits multiple action inputs present in
  `.github/actions/render/action.yml`.
- **MEDIUM: architecture coverage still has two regex/coverage holes.**
  `ArchitectureAppShellTests` can still miss fully-qualified, alias, or
  `global using static` dependency edges, and
  `ArchitectureGenInternalLayeringTests` still omits `Output`, `Targets`,
  `Composition`, and `Execution` roots.

**LOW findings aggregated and still open after iteration 7:**

- The pre-existing StartupHook publication LOW, the `CaptureFileWriter`
  bare-catch diagnostic loss, and the untracked TFM-upgrade TODO remain.
- `JsonNodeFileLoader.TryLoadJsonObject(...)` still collapses parse/I/O
  failures to `null`.
- Residual filename/type drift remains in the four previously documented files
  plus the `OpenCliDocumentPublishability*Support.cs` partial filenames.
- Live-test skip catalogs in `ValidatedGenericHelpFrameworkCases.cs` and
  `CommandLineUtilsHookLiveTests.cs` still use comment-only rationale.
- Several module-local implementation and output-glue types remain `public`
  (`OpenCliGenerationService`, `DocumentRenderService`, `ProcessRunner`,
  `HtmlRenderService`, `ViewerBundleLocator`, `DotnetBuildOutputResolver`,
  `ExecutableResolver`, `RenderRequestFactory`, `CommandOutputHandler`,
  `GenerateOutputHandler`, and related JSON envelope types).
- `README.md` still omits `npm run test:e2e`, the Playwright theme-toggle E2E
  is still conditionally vacuous, `TemporaryAnalysisWorkspace` still swallows
  cleanup failures, installed-command resolution still lacks focused tests, and
  `ArchitectureNamespaceTests` still only validates the first namespace
  declaration per file.
- The older LOWs still remain valid: `HtmlRenderService` does unnecessary
  bundle enumeration before `--single-file --dry-run`, the provider-interface
  + DTO cluster files remain inline by deliberate choice, and the NuGet DTO
  clusters remain intentionally unsplit.

| **g1** | `1b42d79` | 50 | +263 / −250 | Splits 5 small `*Models.cs` files into 16 per-type files; renames `Modes/Static/Models/` → `Metadata/` (eliminating a forbidden `Models/` bucket); updates 29 `using`-directive consumers + 2 fully-qualified references in tests (`CoconaModuleBuilder.cs` line 145, `OpenCliMetadataContractTests.cs` line 63). Complete split list: `StaticAnalysisModels.cs` → 3 files; `CliFxMetadataModels.cs` → 5 files; `IntrospectionModels.cs` → 2 files (keeps `ToStepMetadata` method on `IntrospectionOutcome`); `PackageInspectionModels.cs` → 2 files (keeps `Empty` + `HasToolAssemblyReferencing*` helpers on `SpectrePackageInspection`); `CaptureModels.cs` → 4 files (each with `System.Text.Json.Serialization` using). Zero csproj changes. |
| **g2** | `276a710` | 2 | 0 net | Pure `git mv` rename — `NuGetApiModels.cs` → `NuGetApiDtos.cs`, `NuGetApiSpecModels.cs` → `NuGetApiSpecDtos.cs`. No code references the filename (only the type names), so this is a zero-diff rename. Clears the `*Models.cs` anti-pattern off the entire repo while preserving the two tight-cluster NuGet V3 DTO surfaces. `find src -name "*Models.cs"` returns 0 after this phase. |
| **g3** | `e9d9998` | 1 | +118 | New `tests/InSpectra.Gen.Tests/Architecture/ArchitectureGenInternalLayeringTests.cs`. Four `[Fact]` methods: `OpenCli_does_not_depend_on_Rendering`, `OpenCli_does_not_depend_on_UseCases_or_Commands`, `Rendering_does_not_depend_on_UseCases_or_Commands`, `UseCases_does_not_depend_on_Commands`. Shared helper `AssertNoUpstreamImport(subtree, forbiddenPrefixes)` scans every `*.cs` under `src/InSpectra.Gen/<subtree>/`, regex-matches `using InSpectra.Gen.<ns>;`, and fails when any import hits a forbidden prefix. Crucially asserts `filesScanned > 0` before evaluating violations — guards against the vacuous-green failure mode S6 was looking for. Perturbation-tested by temporarily adding `using InSpectra.Gen.Rendering;` to `src/InSpectra.Gen/OpenCli/Composition/OpenCliServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`, confirming the relevant fact failed with the expected message, then reverting. |
| **g4** | `fde9490` | 15 | +80 / −59 | Splits the 5 service+DTO pair files listed in iteration 2 above. Each split produces 1 service-class file + 2 DTO files, totalling 10 new files + 5 modified files. Preserves `static partial` on `DotnetRuntimeCompatibilitySupport` (required by its `[GeneratedRegex]` source generator). Preserves `HookToolProcessInvocationResolution.FromInvocation` / `.TerminalFailure` factory methods. Preserves `OpenCliCommandTreeNode.Children` init-only property (used via `with` in the recursive tree builder). Zero csproj or namespace changes. |
| **g5** | `450e808` | 4 | +32 / −30 | Splits the 2 cross-boundary service+DTO pairs: `ProcessRunner.cs` → `ProcessRunner.cs` + `ProcessResult.cs` (ProcessResult is referenced from 6 consumer files across Gen+Acquisition); `CliFrameworkProvider.cs` → `CliFrameworkProvider.cs` + `StaticAnalysisFrameworkAdapter.cs` (adapter carries the multi-paragraph type-erasure doc comment from phase 2a, which travels with the type into its own file). The g5 commit body enumerates the 22 remaining 2-type files intentionally left inline under the tight-coupling exception — this retrospective inlines the same list above under "Iteration 2". |
| **g6** | `59ba4a2` | 1 | +11 / −7 | Updates `README.md:542–555` "Project Layout" section from 2 source + 1 test project to 5 source + 2 test projects. New entries: `InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition` (292-file acquisition class library split out in commit `3c10dad`), `InSpectra.Gen.Core` (cross-module primitives — 4 `Cli*Exception` types — landed in phase 3 commit `f558de5`), `InSpectra.Gen.StartupHook` (the `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS` assembly for live `System.CommandLine`/`CommandLineParser`/`CommandLineUtils` capture), `tests/InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition.Tests/` (157-test acquisition suite). Also annotates `tests/InSpectra.Gen.Tests/` with "+ 14 architecture policy tests" (10 pre-existing + 4 from g3). Pure docs — zero code, zero tests, zero csproj. |
| **g7** | `4cae9d4` | 11 | +721 / −283 | Fixes the iteration-1/3 render-path async-I/O deferrals. `MarkdownRenderService` now threads `CancellationToken` through the private layout handlers and uses `File.WriteAllTextAsync` for single/tree/hybrid writes. `HtmlRenderService` no longer copies a bundle just to delete it for `--single-file`; it builds `index.html` directly from the bundle source, uses async file streams for bundle copies, and delegates asset loading / compression to the new `HtmlBundleAssetComposer.cs` (+295) and `HtmlBundleCompression.cs`. Composition ownership is tightened by moving the `ViewerBundleLocatorOptions` configuration from the app shell into `AddInSpectraRendering`. Adds 2 regression tests (`Single_file_render_writes_only_index_html_with_inlined_assets`, `Single_render_writes_output_file`) plus `MarkdownRenderServiceTestSupport.cs`. |
| **g8** | `7cb1ff6` | 8 | +120 / −3 | Hardens the architecture/policy scans that were still vulnerable to empty-surface or wrong-surface greens. `ArchitectureContractsTests`, `ArchitectureContractsModesTests`, and `ArchitectureToolingTests` now assert both non-empty scans and positive namespace anchors; `ArchitectureForbiddenBucketsTests`, `ArchitectureInternalsVisibleToTests`, and `RepositoryCodeFilePolicyTests` assert that they actually scanned something; `ArchitectureNamespaceTests` narrows the namespace exception from a filename-wide `StartupHook.cs` carve-out to the specific `src/InSpectra.Gen.StartupHook/StartupHook.cs` path. |
| **g9** | `45a1fcc` | 15 | −1590 | Removes the dead live-result snapshot path entirely: deletes `HookResultSnapshotSupport.cs`, deletes the 2 unreferenced `HookResultSnapshots/*.json` fixtures, prunes 11 orphan `HookOpenCliSnapshots/*.json` artifacts that no active case catalog consumes, and removes the now-unused `SerializeForComparison` helper from `HookOpenCliSnapshotSupport.cs`. The active hook/live snapshot set now matches the current `HookServiceLiveTests` and `CommandLineUtilsHookLiveTests` catalogs exactly. |
| **g10** | `50a466f` | 5 | +83 / −28 | Closes the accepted code/test findings from the fresh iteration-4 swarm. Removes the orphaned synchronous `CollectReferencedAssets(...)` helper pair from `HtmlBundleComposer.cs` / `HtmlBundleAssetComposer.cs`, relaxes `ArchitectureAppShellTests` by dropping the brittle "must contain at least one Acquisition using" anchor, and hardens `ArchitectureModeTests` so it now (a) scans recursively for forbidden descendant `OpenCli` folders, (b) proves the scanned `Modes/` surface still contains source files plus `InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition.Modes.*` namespaces, and (c) skips `bin/obj` output while doing so. A verifier pass rejected broader `StartupHook` / `Output` / `Execution` test additions as over-broad or still-vacuous, so they were deliberately not shipped in this phase. |
| **g11** | `2a6a706` | 2 | +185 / −96 | Refreshes the follow-up ledger to the post-`g10` tree and updates `ArchitectureModeTests.cs` to match the refreshed retrospective/scan expectations. This is the first post-iteration-4 docs+test sync point and the baseline the current run resumed from. |
| **g12** | `97fa06c` | 4 | +26 / −8 | Decouples the OpenCLI and rendering serializers from the app-shell `Output.Json` helper surface by switching `OpenCliDocumentSerializer`, `OpenCliJsonSanitizer`, `HtmlBundleAssetComposer`, and `HtmlBundleBootstrapSupport` onto module-local JSON formatting instead of the output-layer helper. |
| **g13** | `1b8ab00` | 5 | +9 / −9 | Aligns schema and process DTO ownership: moves `OpenCli.draft.json` under `src/InSpectra.Gen/OpenCli/Schema/`, updates `OpenCliSchemaProvider` to the new path, and splits `InstalledToolContext` out of `CommandInstallationSupport.cs` into its own `Tooling/Process/InstalledToolContext.cs` file. |
| **g14** | `8e5d093` | 4 | +156 / −12 | Removes the remaining synchronous preflight checks from the async file-loading boundary in `OpenCliDocumentLoader`, `OpenCliXmlEnricher`, and `DocumentRenderService`, while preserving the existing CLI-usage error contract. Adds `OpenCliFileLoadingErrorTests.cs` and exposes `DocumentRenderService.LoadXmlDocumentAsync` to the test assembly for focused regression coverage. |
| **g15** | `4b707e4` | 6 | −675 | Deletes the orphaned `Tooling/Introspection/` subtree and the dead `JsonDocumentStabilitySupport.cs` helper after caller scans and verifier swarms confirmed they had no remaining repo-local consumers. |
| **g16** | `dbad3e8` | 6 | +435 / −49 | Converts OpenCLI artifact emission onto an async staged-write path. `OpenCliAcquisitionResultFactory`, `OpenCliNativeAcquisitionSupport`, and `OpenCliAcquisitionService` now await `WriteArtifactsAsync(...)`; the writer validates all requested paths before the first write, stages payloads asynchronously, and the new `OpenCliArtifactWriterTests` / `OpenCliArtifactWriterTestDoubles` cover success, cancellation, path-validation ordering, native acquisition, and real-service success-path artifact persistence. |
| **g17** | `db764d4` | 4 | +443 / −100 | Restores packaged-vs-repo viewer bundle precedence in mixed states. `ViewerBundleLocator` now keeps the packaged bundle reachable when repo metadata exists but `dist` is missing, stale, or build-disabled in the specific accepted mixed-state cases, and the oversized viewer test matrix is split into `ViewerBundleLocatorMixedStateTests`, `ViewerBundleLocatorRepositoryResolutionTests`, and shared `ViewerBundleLocatorTestSupport`. |
| **g18** | `cc794da` | 3 | +63 / −10 | Hardens the verifier-loop edge cases from `g16` and `g17`. `OpenCliArtifactWriter` now cleans staged temp files on cancelled staging, enforces `Overwrite=false` again at commit time, rolls back earlier publishes if a later publish fails, and treats backup-file deletion as best-effort cleanup instead of a transactional failure. `ViewerBundleLocator` now uses the same "newest available stale bundle wins" rule when repo rebuild fails as it already used for the explicit `allowBuild: false` path. |
| **g19** | `e9e8314` | 6 | +126 / −85 | Makes the indexed NuGet live tests non-vacuous. `NuGetApiClientLiveTests` no longer returns early when `index/packages/` is missing; instead it fails fast via `NuGetApiClientLiveTestSupport` and loads a tracked `latest/metadata.json` fixture set for `Cake.Tool`, `dotnet-trace`, `dotnet-serve`, and `Paket`, so the registration/search/autocomplete live slice actually executes in CI. |
| **g20** | `e1aba49` | 4 | +24 | Adds the matching versioned `metadata.json` fixtures for the optional `INSPECTRA_GEN_LIVE_NUGET_SCOPE=all` path, so the "all versions" live slice no longer collapses to an empty dataset. |
| **g21** | `743b7c1` | 5 | +1 / −377 | Removes the last dead acquisition API tail still left after `g15`: deletes `JsonPayloadRepair.cs`, deletes the stale duplicate `Tooling/Process/{RuntimeSupport,ProcessResult,SandboxEnvironment}` stack, and collapses `JsonNodeFileLoader` to the one live `TryLoadJsonObject(...)` entrypoint. |
| **g22** | `f9a182e` | 2 | +221 / −39 | Makes hook retries capture-path-safe. `HookProcessRetrySupport` now gives each attempt its own isolated `INSPECTRA_CAPTURE_PATH`, bases retry decisions on that attempt only, and publishes only the final chosen capture back to the requested path. Adds a regression test covering the stale/locked capture case. |
| **g23** | `098793d` | 5 | +62 / −15 | Hardens backend policy/CI coverage. `ArchitectureProjectDependencyTests` now requires exact charter coverage for backend `.csproj` files, `ArchitectureForbiddenBucketsTests` asserts it actually scanned at least one top-level directory, the two Windows-specific backend tests are tagged explicitly, and `ci.yml` adds a dedicated `windows-backend-tests` job while filtering that category out of the Ubuntu lane. |
| **g24** | `4334fcd` | 5 | +76 / −15 | Realigns the public CI contract. The reusable workflow now forwards `title`, `command-prefix`, and caller-controlled `output-dir`, uploads artifacts from that same path, and `README.md` + `docs/CI/*` now document `markdown-hybrid`, `split-depth`, the current HTML input surface, and the corrected quick-start output path. |
| **g25** | `4629679` | 4 | +123 / −9 | Preserves the surviving retry capture when copying the final attempt capture back to the requested path fails. `HookProcessRetrySupport` now returns both the process result and the effective capture path, and `HookInstalledToolAnalysisSupport` consumes that surfaced path instead of assuming the requested capture exists. Adds focused retry/publication regression coverage. |
| **g26** | `411aae5` | 7 | +67 / −47 | Fixes the public action/docs drift found by the fresh post-`g24` swarm. `markdown-hybrid` verification now matches the real leaf-only output shape, the HTML docs explain that compression level 2 already yields self-contained output unless `--single-file` is explicitly forced, and the docs now describe the auto-added package reference / argument forwarding behavior accurately. Pure contract/docs cleanup — no runtime change. |
| **g27** | `a4cfb41` | 8 | +45 / −37 | Extracts the remaining cross-file CliFx and archive-inspection leaf records (`CliFxCommandNode`, `CliFxCaptureSummary`, `PackageArchiveAssemblyInspection`, and verifier-driven `CliFxCrawlResult`) into dedicated sibling files so the owner service files no longer hide externally consumed types inline. |
| **g28** | `c838a3e` | 4 | +30 / −24 | Extracts `ScannedModule` and `StaticAnalysisAssemblyInspectionResult` into sibling files under `Modes.Static.Inspection`, preserving disposal ownership plus the existing factory/outcome API while removing two more post-g5 cross-file inline type exceptions. |
| **g29** | `fd3cbfc` | 7 | +17 / −1 | Starts the app-shell import-localization work needed before cutting internal global usings. Narrows the private composition seam by splitting `AddExecutionServices()` out of `AddTargetServices()` and adds the missing explicit imports in the touched command/output/composition files. |
| **g30** | `eb1dfc4` | 3 | +4 / −1 | Continues the same prep by localizing the remaining `UseCases.Generate` imports in the generate entry points so those files compile without relying on project-wide `GlobalUsings.cs`. |
| **g31** | `ce6b0e5` | 3 | +261 / −76 | Makes `generate --out` plus requested OpenCLI/crawl artifacts one staged publication transaction. Failures no longer leave partially published mixed output sets on disk because the whole output group now commits or rolls back together. |
| **g32** | `d979a40` | 4 | +371 / −55 | Moves HTML and Markdown rendering onto staged publication. Renderers now write into staging locations first and only swap into the requested destination after the full render succeeds, so overwrite paths no longer destroy the previous output before a successful render. |
| **g33** | `b34bbc7` | 4 | +5 | Localizes the OpenCli serialization/enrichment imports that were still being satisfied through app-shell global usings. This is pure ownership cleanup preparing for the final global-using removal. |
| **g34** | `93c596a` | 5 | +16 / −3 | Localizes the remaining rendering/OpenCli imports in rendering composition and pipeline services that still depended on the app-shell globals. Behavior is unchanged; this finishes the import-prep slice before the hard cut. |
| **g35** | `cb67921` | 5 | +162 / −145 | Removes the `Rendering -> Execution.Process` leak by moving npm/process launch support under rendering ownership. `ViewerBundleLocator` now resolves npm and runs frontend builds locally without importing the execution module. |
| **g36** | `5fa6b08` | 4 | +44 / −43 | Extracts the remaining shared acquisition helpers `DotnetToolPackageLayoutBuilder` and `ScannedModuleMetadata` into their own files because both were already consumed across file boundaries and no longer fit the inline-helper exception. |
| **g37** | `daad781` | 5 | +29 / −12 | Aligns the render workflow contract and CI permissions: the default workflow permissions drop to read-only, write scopes move to the jobs that need them, live tests are excluded from the general build-test lane, package-mode xmldoc handling matches the published action contract, and the UI guide is updated to the same surface. |
| **g38** | `cdd4398` | 31 | +480 / −343 | Deletes `src/InSpectra.Gen/GlobalUsings.cs`, localizes the remaining app-shell imports explicitly, and adds an architecture guard forbidding internal project-wide `global using InSpectra.Gen.*` directives in the app shell. The verifier loop also forced practical line-limit splits, so `OutputPathHelper` support and the viewer-bundle process support moved into focused companion files without changing behavior. |
| **g39** | `f0cb1a3` | 5 | +91 / −29 | Closes the final verifier findings from the fresh post-`g38` swarm. Directory publication now uses the same transactional swap path even when the destination already exists but is empty, and HTML rendering now rejects incomplete viewer bundles when `static.html` references missing assets. Adds focused regression coverage for both paths. |

### New smell categories / lessons learned

1. **Filename-based grep misses half the multi-type files.** Category 6
   originally said "grep for `*Models.cs`". That filename-first approach
   caught 7 files in iteration 1 (phase g1) but missed 5 more with
   service-style filenames (`HookToolProcessInvocationResolver.cs`,
   `ToolDescriptorResolver.cs`, `DotnetRuntimeCompatibilitySupport.cs`,
   `DotnetToolSettingsReader.cs`, `OpenCliCommandTreeBuilder.cs`) whose
   bodies declared a service class + 2 DTO records. The authoritative
   scan must key on **top-level type count**, not filename. Category 6
   above has been updated to embed the correct script; see the
   `for f in $(find src -name "*.cs" ...)` block.

2. **Sealed discriminated unions are not multi-type smells.** A file
   containing `internal abstract class MethodValue;` followed by 9
   `internal sealed class StringValue : MethodValue` etc. is a closed
   algebraic data type. Splitting hurts readability because the whole
   case analysis lives together in one place where pattern-match
   exhaustiveness can be eyeballed. `SystemCommandLineMethodValues.cs`
   (10 variants) and `SystemCommandLineConstructorValues.cs` (9
   variants) are the reference examples. Category 6 above lists this
   explicitly as a legitimate exception.

3. **"Service + file-private result DTO" is a legitimate inline
   pattern.** The charter's original wording said "tiny **private** DTO
   clusters with a strong reason to stay inline". The strict reading
   (only `private` nested types) would force splitting all 22 of the
   service+DTO pairs listed under iteration 2. The practical reading —
   "DTO clusters with zero external consumers" — matches the C#
   ecosystem convention and keeps the code readable. The test is
   `git grep -l ResultType | wc -l`: if the count is 1 (only the
   defining file), the type is file-private in practice even when
   declared `internal`. Phase g5 applied this rule to the 22 deferred
   pairs and split only the 2 where the DTO crossed a folder boundary.

4. **Category 10 is now test-enforced.** Phase g3 added
   `ArchitectureGenInternalLayeringTests` with 4 facts covering the 4
   critical pairwise invariants from `Commands → UseCases → Rendering →
   OpenCli`. A 5th potential pair (`Output ⊄ UseCases`) and a 6th
   (`Execution ⊄ Rendering`) are still grep-only. A future phase can
   add them if drift is observed. The test file at
   `tests/InSpectra.Gen.Tests/Architecture/ArchitectureGenInternalLayeringTests.cs`
   is a working template — adding a new fact is a 4-line change.

5. **Watch for "stated intent vs. actual diff" in commit messages.** The
   iteration 1 S7 investigator cited the commit message of `1789504`
   ("fix: StartupHook thread safety, capture logging, and loop guard
   limits"), which explicitly claimed "Convert internal static fields
   (`CapturePath`, `SystemCommandLineAssembly`, `FrameworkAssembly`) to
   `Volatile.Write/Read` backed properties". A `git show 1789504` check
   revealed the diff only actually modified `_captured`/`_patched`
   `Interlocked.CompareExchange` flags and a `ConcurrentBag`
   conversion — the named field conversions were never performed.
   `git blame` confirmed the fields have been plain `internal static`
   since `c1e09b4` (initial migrate). **Rule: a fresh investigator must
   verify commit claims via `git show` before treating them as ground
   truth**, especially when the claim is about a specific identifier.

6. **Iteration 1 S4's "misplaced `OpenCliNormalizer`" was an F2 fix, not
   a smell.** An investigator unfamiliar with the commit history
   proposed moving the normalizer from `Rendering/Pipeline/` back to
   `OpenCli/Enrichment/` because its name starts with "OpenCli".
   Phase f2 (commit `c9fc3b6`) had moved it the other way explicitly
   to break a charter-violating `OpenCli → Rendering` cycle — the
   normalizer returns `Rendering.Pipeline.Model.NormalizedCliDocument`,
   a flat form specifically shaped for rendering consumption.
   Reverting that move would re-introduce the cycle that phase g3's
   `OpenCli_does_not_depend_on_Rendering` test now catches. **Rule:
   investigators must read the commit messages touching any file
   they propose to move** — especially files in `Rendering/` or
   `OpenCli/`.

7. **Async refactors often leave dead sync helper tails behind.** Phase g7
   correctly moved the live render path onto async file I/O, but it left the
   synchronous `CollectReferencedAssets(...)` wrapper pair in
   `HtmlBundleComposer.cs` / `HtmlBundleAssetComposer.cs`. They had no
   remaining call sites and only survived because the refactor preserved the
   old helper surface while switching callers to the async path. **Rule: when
   converting a helper chain from sync to async, grep both definitions and
   call sites before declaring the old sync half intentionally retained.**

8. **Positive anchors should prove the scanned surface, not freeze an entire
   tree shape.** The first iteration-4 hardening attempt for
   `ArchitectureModeTests` overfit the current repo by requiring every mode to
   carry `Projection/` plus matching namespaces. Verifier swarms showed that
   this solved the vacuous-green problem by accidentally turning a dependency
   rule into a completeness rule. The final shape is intentionally narrower:
   prove that the scan hit real `Modes/*` source files and at least one real
   `Modes.*` namespace, then enforce only the specific forbidden condition.

9. **Do not treat `Task.md` target-state aspirations as current stop-condition
   defects during follow-up sweeps.** The iteration-4 dependency agent raised
   broad `Output.Json` / `Targets/*` ownership claims by leaning on the older
   restructure task document. For this follow-up, the self-contained source of
   truth is the Followup doc set plus the live charter, not every historical
   migration desideratum in `Task.md`. **Rule: if a finding depends on the
   older task doc instead of the smell categories and explicit exceptions in
   these docs, it needs extra proof before it can block the stop condition.**
10. **Internal project-wide global usings can make regex architecture tests
    lie green.** The app shell compiled because `GlobalUsings.cs` quietly
    satisfied imports that the dependency scanners never saw, so the layering
    tests looked clean while the compiler still had access to deep internals.
    The safer pattern is explicit imports in the few files that need them,
    plus a guard that forbids internal `global using InSpectra.Gen.*`
    directives from returning.
11. **Transactional directory publication must use the same swap path even
    when the destination already exists but is empty.** The original staged
    publication path only took the full backup/swap route when the destination
    directory was already populated; the "existing but empty" branch promoted
    children entry-by-entry and silently lost rollback safety. Empty
    destinations still need the same atomic swap contract as populated ones.
12. **Bundle existence is not bundle completeness.** A viewer bundle can have
    both `index.html` and `static.html` present yet still be broken if
    `static.html` references missing assets. The validator has to inspect the
    referenced asset set, not just the top-level file names, before publishing
    or inlining the bundle.

### Still-open items after iteration 7

The original stop condition is **not met** on the current post-`g39` tree.
The fresh post-`g38` swarm still surfaced valid HIGH/MEDIUM findings, two of
which were fixed in `g39`; the remainder stay open because the user explicitly
ended the outer loop after this iteration. The already resolved iteration-3
sync-I/O findings, the iteration-5 viewer/artifact/live-test MEDIUMs, and the
iteration-6 dead-helper / hook-retry / CI-contract / coverage MEDIUMs should
still **not** be re-raised.

**Open HIGH/MEDIUM findings:**

- **HIGH: CI still does not run the Playwright E2E suite.**
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` does not execute `npm run test:e2e`, so the UI
  E2E coverage under `src/InSpectra.UI/e2e/` is not part of hosted CI.
- **MEDIUM: viewer-build failures lose stdout diagnostics.**
  `src/InSpectra.Gen/Rendering/Html/Bundle/ViewerBundleProcessSupport.cs`
  only reports stderr on failure.
- **MEDIUM: multi-TFM installed-dotnet-tool resolution is nondeterministic.**
  `src/InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition/Tooling/Process/InstalledDotnetToolCommandSupport.cs`
  returns the first matching `DotnetToolSettings.xml` under the install tree,
  so enumeration order can pick the wrong entry point/runtimeconfig.
- **MEDIUM: rendering contracts still leak a pipeline concrete.**
  `src/InSpectra.Gen/Rendering/Contracts/IDocumentRenderService.cs` exposes
  `AcquiredRenderDocument` from `src/InSpectra.Gen/Rendering/Pipeline/`.
- **MEDIUM: docs/UI still drift from the action and Pages behavior.**
  `README.md` advertises example bundles that the Pages jobs do not publish,
  and `src/InSpectra.UI/src/components/CIGuidePage.tsx` still omits multiple
  inputs present in `.github/actions/render/action.yml`.
- **MEDIUM: app-shell architecture scanning is still regex-limited.**
  `tests/InSpectra.Gen.Tests/Architecture/ArchitectureAppShellTests.cs` can
  still miss fully-qualified, alias, or `global using static` dependency
  edges.
- **MEDIUM: internal layering coverage still omits several roots.**
  `tests/InSpectra.Gen.Tests/Architecture/ArchitectureGenInternalLayeringTests.cs`
  still does not cover `Output`, `Targets`, `Composition`, or `Execution`.

**Open LOW findings and intentional exceptions:**

- **`StartupHook/SystemCommandLine/HarmonyPatchInstaller.cs:12–13`**
  (and the sibling files
  `CommandLineParser/CommandLineParserPatchInstaller.cs`,
  `CommandLineUtils/CommandLineUtilsPatchInstaller.cs`,
  `Hooking/AssemblyLoadInterceptor.cs`) still use plain `internal static`
  field publication. Pre-existing since `c1e09b4`; not fixed here because no
  live failure has reproduced it and the clean fix is style churn outside this
  follow-up.
- **`StartupHook/Capture/CaptureFileWriter.cs:103`** still has a bare
  `catch { return null; }`, and
  **`StartupHook/Capture/CaptureFileWriter.cs:12`** still carries the
  untracked TFM-upgrade TODO about `DefaultIgnoreCondition`.
- **`Acquisition/Tooling/Json/JsonNodeFileLoader.cs:7`** still collapses
  parse/I/O failures to `null`, hiding the exact load failure reason.
- **Filename/type drift** remains LOW-only in
  `Modes/CliFx/Execution/CliFxToolRuntime.cs`,
  `Modes/Static/Inspection/StaticAnalysisToolRuntime.cs`,
  `Modes/Static/Inspection/StaticAnalysisInstalledToolAnalysisSupport.cs`,
  `tests/InSpectra.Gen.Acquisition.Tests/SystemCommandLine/SystemCommandLineConstructorTestModuleBuilder.cs`,
  and the `OpenCliDocumentPublishability*Support.cs` partial filenames.
- **Live-test skip catalogs with comment-only rationale** remain LOW-only in
  `ValidatedGenericHelpFrameworkCases.cs` and
  `CommandLineUtilsHookLiveTests.cs`.
- **Module-local implementation and output-glue types remain public** — for
  example `UseCases/Generate/OpenCliGenerationService.cs`,
  `Rendering/Pipeline/DocumentRenderService.cs`,
  `Execution/Process/ProcessRunner.cs`,
  `Rendering/Html/HtmlRenderService.cs`,
  `Rendering/Html/Bundle/ViewerBundleLocator.cs`,
  `Targets/Sources/DotnetBuildOutputResolver.cs`,
  `Targets/Inputs/ExecutableResolver.cs`,
  `Output/RenderRequestFactory.cs`,
  `Output/CommandOutputHandler.cs`, and
  `Output/GenerateOutputHandler.cs`.
- **Documentation/test hygiene LOWs** remain: `README.md` still omits
  `npm run test:e2e`, the Playwright theme-toggle E2E only asserts when the
  toggle exists, `TemporaryAnalysisWorkspace` still swallows cleanup failures,
  installed-command resolution still lacks focused regression tests, and
  `ArchitectureNamespaceTests` still validates only the first namespace
  declaration per file.
- **Render-path LOWs** remain: `HtmlRenderService` still enumerates bundle
  assets before the `--single-file --dry-run` fast path, and the rendering
  bundle helpers still use synchronous recursive scans / best-effort cleanup
  in a few non-blocking paths.
- **The small provider-interface + DTO cluster files remain intentionally
  inline** in `ICliFrameworkCatalog.cs`, `ILocalCliFrameworkDetector.cs`,
  `IPackageCliToolInstaller.cs`, and `IAcquisitionAnalysisDispatcher.cs`.
  This is the same deliberate g5-style exception documented earlier.
- **`NuGetApiDtos.cs` and `NuGetApiSpecDtos.cs` remain intentionally
  unsplit.** They are still tight external-contract DTO clusters, not junk
  multi-type files.

### If another iteration is warranted

Because the user stopped the outer loop early, the next sensible iteration is
still **stop-condition work**, not just low-only cleanup. The highest-value
next scopes are:

- **Wire Playwright E2E into hosted CI** so `npm run test:e2e` becomes part of
  the branch/PR signal.
- **Make installed-dotnet-tool resolution deterministic for multi-TFM tools**
  and add focused regression coverage for the chosen selection rules.
- **Move `AcquiredRenderDocument` out of the rendering contracts leak** so
  `IDocumentRenderService` stops exposing a pipeline concrete.
- **Reconcile docs/UI with actual publishing behavior** by either publishing
  the advertised example bundles and full input surface or narrowing the docs
  and UI guide to the truth.
- **Harden the architecture scanners beyond regex-only `using` detection**, or
  replace the remaining brittle scans with Roslyn-backed analysis before
  expanding coverage to `Output`, `Targets`, `Composition`, and `Execution`.
